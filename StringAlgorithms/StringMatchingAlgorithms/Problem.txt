we concentrate on checking whether a pattern P is a substring of another string T
(T stands for text) or not. Since we are trying to check a fixed string P, sometimes these
algorithms are called exact string matching algorithms. To simplify our discussion, let us assume
that the length of given text T is n and the length of the pattern P which we are trying to match has
the length m. That means, T has the characters from 0 to n – 1 (T[0 ...n – 1]) and P has the
characters from 0 to m – 1 (P[0 ...m – 1]). 

Following are some of the algorithms that we will look

• Brute Force Method
• Rabin-Karp String Matching Algorithm
• String Matching with Finite Automata
• KMP Algorithm
• Boyer-Moore Algorithm
• Suffix Trees
